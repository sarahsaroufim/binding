    <h4>FOREWORD</h4>
    
    <p>
        There are many books about typography, and some of them are models of the art they teach. But when I set myself to compile a simple list of working principles, one of the benchmarks I first thought of was William Strunk and E.B. White's small masterpiece, The Elements of Style. Brevity, however, is the essence of Strunk & White's manual of literary technique. This book is longer than theirs, and for that there is a cause.
    </p>

    <blockquote id="typography-quote">
        Typography makes at least two kinds of sense, if it makes any sense at all. It makes visual & historical sense.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        The visual side of typography is always on display, and materials for the study of its visual form are many and widespread. The history of letterforms and their usage is visible too, to those with access to manuscripts, inscriptions and old books, but from others it is largely hidden.
    </p>

    <p>
        This book has therefore grown into something more than a short manual of typographic etiquette. It is the fruit of a lot of long walks in the wilderness of letters: in part a pocket field guide to the living wonders that are found there, and in part a meditation on the ecological principles, survival techniques and ethics that apply.

    <h4>HISTORICAL SYNOPSIS</h4>

    <p id="example-1">
        abpfoe
        <span id="example-1-b">
        abpfoe
        </span>

    <p>
        <span class="example-title">BAROQUE —</span>
        <span class="example-date">17th century:</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        modulated stroke; variable axis; modeled serifs and terminals; moderate aperture; italic subsidiary to roman and closely linked with it. A secondary vertical axis often develops in Baroque letters - but the primary axis of the penstroke is normally oblique.

        <span class="example-title">REALIST —</span>
        <span class="example-date">19th-20th centuries:</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        unmodulated stroke; implied vertical axis; small aperture; serifs absent or abrupt and of equal weight with main strokes; italic absent or replaced by sloped roman.

    <h4>THE GRAND DESIGN</h4>

    <p class="chapter-number-b">1.1</p>

    <h5>FIRST PRINCIPLES</h5>

    <p class="chapter-number-c">1.1.1</p>

    <h6>TYPOGRAPHY EXISTS TO HONOR CONTENT</h6>

    <p>
        Like oratory, music, dance, calligraphy - like anything that lends its grace to language - typography is an art that can be deliberately misused. It is a craft by which the meanings of a text (or its absence of meaning) can be clarified, honored and shared, or knowingly disguised.
    </p>

    <p>
        In a world rife with unsolicited messages, typography must often draw attention to itself before it will be read. Yet in order to be read, it must relinquish the attention it has drawn. Typography with anything to say therefore aspires to a kind of statuesque transparency. Its other traditional goal is durability: not immunity to change, but a clear superiority to fashion. Typography at its best is a visual form of language linking timelessness and time.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the principles of durable typography is always legibility; another is something more than legibility: some earned or unearned interest that gives its living energy to the page. It takes various forms and goes by various names, including serenity, liveliness, laughter, grace and joy.
    </p>

    <p class="chapter-number-c">1.1.2</p>

    <h6>LETTERS HAVE A LIFE AND DIGNITY OF THEIR OWN</h6>

    <p>
        Letterforms that honor and elucidate what humans see and say deserve to be honored in their turn. Well-chosen words deserve well-chosen letters; these in their turn deserve to be set with affection, intelligence, knowledge and skill. Typography is a link, and it ought, as a matter of honor, courtesy and pure delight, to be as strong as the others in the chain.
    </p>

    <p>
        Writing begins with the making of footprints, the leaving of signs. Like speaking, it is a perfectly natural act which humans have carried to complex extremes. The typographer's task has always been to add a somewhat unnatural edge, a protective shell of artificial order, to the power of the writing hand.
