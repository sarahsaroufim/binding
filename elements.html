<h2><span class="h2-numbers">1.</span><br>FOREWORD</h2>
    
<p class="main-text">
There are many books about typo&shy;graphy, and some of them are models of the art they teach. But when I set myself to compile a simple list of working prin&shy;ciples, one of the bench&shy;marks I first thought of was William Strunk and E.B. White's small master&shy;piece, The Elements of Style. Brevity, however, is the essence of Strunk & White's manual of literary technique. This book is longer than theirs, and for that there is a&nbsp;cause.
</p>

<blockquote id="typography-quote">
Typography makes at least two kinds of sense, if it makes any sense at all. It makes visual sense &&nbsp;historical&nbsp;sense.
</blockquote>

<p class="main-text">
The visual side of typography is always on display, and materials for the study of its visual form are many and widespread. The history of letterforms and their usage is visible too, to those with access to manuscripts, inscriptions and old books, from others it's largely&nbsp;hidden.
</p>

<p class="main-text">
This book has therefore grown into something more than a short manual of typographic etiquette. It is the fruit of a lot of long walks in the wilder&shy;ness of letters: in part a pocket field guide to the living wonders that are found there, and in part a meditation on the ecological principles, survival techniques and ethics that&nbsp;apply.
</p>

<p class="main-text">
One question, nevertheless, has been often in my mind. When all right-thinking human beings are struggling to remember that other men and women are free to be different, and free to become more different, how can one honestly write a rulebook? What reason and authority exist for these command&shy;ments, suggestions and instructions? Certainly typo&shy;graphers, like others, ought to be at liberty to follow or to blaze the trails they&nbsp;choose.

<section>
<h3>3.1<br>FIRST PRINCIPLES</h3>

<section>
<h4>3.1.1<br>TYPOGRAPHY EXISTS TO HONOR CONTENT</h4>

<p class="main-text">
Like oratory, music, dance, calligraphy — like anything that lends its grace to language — typography is an art that can be deliberately misused. It is a craft by which the meanings of a text (or its absence of meaning) can be clarified, honored and shared, or knowingly disguised.
</p>

<p class="main-text">
In a world rife with unsolicited messages, typography must often draw attention to itself before it will be read. Yet in order to be read, it must relinquish the attention it has drawn. Typography with anything to say therefore aspires to a kind of statuesque transparency. Its other traditional goal is durability: not immunity to change, but a clear super&shy;iority to fashion. Typography at its best is a visual form of language linking timelessness and&nbsp;time.
</p>

<p class="main-text">
One of the principles of durable typo&shy;graphy is always legibility; another is something more than legibility: some earned or unearned interest that gives its living energy to the page. It takes various forms and goes by various names, including serenity, liveliness, laughter, grace and&nbsp;joy.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4 class="subtitle-top-margin">3.1.2<br>LETTERS HAVE A LIFE AND DIGNITY OF THEIR OWN</h4>

<p class="main-text">
Letterforms that honor and elucidate what humans see and say deserve to be honored in their turn. Well-chosen words deserve well-chosen letters; these in their turn deserve to be set with affection, intelligence, know&shy;ledge and skill. Typography is a link, and it ought, as a matter of honor, courtesy and pure delight, to be as strong as the others in the&nbsp;chain.
</p>

<p class="main-text">
Writing begins with the making of footprints, the leaving of signs. Like speaking, it is a perfectly natural act which humans have carried to complex extremes. The typographer's task has always been to add a some&shy;what unnatural edge, a protective shell of artificial order, to the power of the writing&nbsp;hand.
</p>  
</section>

</section>
<h3 class="subtitle-top-margin">3.2<br>TACTICS</h3>

<section>
<h4>3.2.1<br>READ THE TEXT BEFORE DESIGNING IT</h4>

<p class="main-text">
The typographer's one essential task is to interpret and communicate the text. Its tone, its tempo, its logical structure, its physical size, all determine the possibilities of its typographic form. The typographer is to the text as the theatrical director to the script, or the musician to the score. 
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4 class="subtitle-top-margin">3.2.2<br>DISCOVER THE OUTER LOGIC OF THE TYPOGRAPHY IN THE INNER LOGIC OF THE TEXT</h4>

<p class="main-text">
A novel often purports to be a seamless river of words from beginning to end, or a series of unnamed scenes. Research papers, textbooks, cookbooks and other works of nonfiction rarely look so smooth. They are often layered with chapter heads, section heads, subheads, block quotations, footnotes, endnotes, lists and illustrative examples. Such features may be obscure in the manuscript, even if they are clear in the author's mind. For the sake of the reader, each requires its own typographic identity and form. Every layer and level of the text must be consistent, distinct, yet (usually) harmonious in&nbsp;form.

<h2><span class="h2-numbers">4.</span><br>RHYTHM & PROPORTION</h2>

<section>
<h3>4.1<br>HORIZONTAL MOTION</h3>

<p class="main-text">
An ancient metaphor: thought is a thread, and the raconteur is 2 a spinner of yarns - but the true storyteller, the poet, is a weaver. The scribes made this old and audible abstraction into a new and visible fact. After long practice, their work took on such an even, flexible texture that they called the written page a textus, which means cloth.
</p>

<p class="main-text">
The typesetting device, whether it happens to be a computer or a composing stick, functions like a loom. And the typographer, like the scribe, normally aims to weave the text as evenly as possible. Good letterforms are designed to give a lively, even texture, but careless spacing of letters, lines and words can tear this fabric apart.
</p>

<section id="squares-container">
<h4 class="subtitle-top-margin">4.1.1<br>DEFINE THE WORD SPACE TO SUIT THE SIZE AND NATURAL LETTERFIT OF THE FONT</h4>

<p class="main-text">
Type is normally measured in picas and points (explained in detail on pages 328-329), but horizontal spacing is measured in ems, and the em is a sliding measure. One em is a distance equal to the type size. In 6 point type, an em is 6 points; in 12 pt type it is 12 points, and in 60 pt type it is 60 points. Thus a one-em space is proportionately the same in any size.
